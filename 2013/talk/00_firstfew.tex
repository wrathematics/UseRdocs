 \begin{block}{Conventions}
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item 
    We use:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item ``{\Huge$ .$}'' as a decimal mark
    \item ``{\Huge$,$}'' as order of magnitude separator
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\hline
      Example & Yes & No \\\hline
      One million & 1,000,000 & 1.000.000\\
      One half & 0.5 & 0,5\\
      One thousand and one half & $1,000.5$ & $1.000,5$\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
%     \item We will use special suffixes to denote distributed objects (ones not stored entirely on a single processor).\\
%     \code{.spmd} denotes a distributed object, while\\
%     \code{.dmat} denotes a distributed object which is of class \code{ddmatrix}\\
%     No suffix means the object is global (common to all processors)\\[.2cm]
%     Neither of these suffices carries semantic meaning.
